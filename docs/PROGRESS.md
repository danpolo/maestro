# Maestro — Build Progress

Live state of the build. **Update after every stage and commit.** This file plus `docs/DESIGN.md`
and `docs/EXECUTION.md` must be enough for a fresh session to resume with no other context.

Process: `docs/EXECUTION.md`. Design: `docs/DESIGN.md`.

## Status

| Stage | Status | Completed | Verified by |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 — Package skeleton + characterisation harness | pending | — | — |
| M1 — Core extraction | pending | — | — |
| M2 — Backend drivers + mid-work switching | pending | — | — |
| M3 — Model limits + self-update | pending | — | — |
| M4 — Setup: init, doctor, skills | pending | — | — |
| M5 — Cutover of reference project | pending | — | — |
| M6 — Live switching validation | pending | — | — |

**Current stage:** M0 — not started.

**Mode:** unattended. All three formerly-gated actions are pre-authorised by the operator — see
`docs/EXECUTION.md` "Unattended operation". Do not stop to ask permission; stop only on an abort
condition or at the context ceiling.

## Baseline captured 2026-08-09

Recorded before any work began, so drift is detectable.

- Reference project: `/home/dan/projects/AbuAliArchive`, HEAD `68056b5`
- Its autonomous loop: **live and idle** (`idle_gated`, all tasks gated), watchdog + orchestrator
  running under tmux session `abuali-watchdog`
- Reference file under extraction: `scripts/orchestrator_run.py`, 4,567 lines
- Superseded scripts total ≈ 8,300 lines across 16 files
- Complexity hotspots: `main` 249, `poll_control_commands` 46, `_show_manual` 40, `park_failed` 37,
  `parse_prep_tasks` 33, `_resolve_limit_reset` 32, `parse_runnable_tasks` 30
- Hardcoded project references in `orchestrator_run.py`: 3 (all `/tmp/abuali-*` path prefixes)
- Toolchain: Python 3.11.2, pytest 9.1.1

## Findings

_Append one bullet per stage: measured numbers, surprises, resolved open questions._

- (none yet)

## Open questions

Carried from `docs/DESIGN.md` §13. Resolve during the stage noted; record the answer here.

- **M2** — Does `codex exec` expose a resume handle stable enough for `native_resume = True`, or must
  the Codex driver always re-brief?
- **M2** — Can the Codex statusline be sampled on the same cadence as Claude's, or does it need polling?
- **M2/M6** — Calibration of the default usage-threshold percentages (currently 85% five-hour,
  90% weekly) once switching has run for real.
- **M3** — Exact stall-detection window and the definition of journal progress for the generic watchdog.
- **M4** — Should `upcoming.py` explanation generation be backend-agnostic or pinned to one role?
